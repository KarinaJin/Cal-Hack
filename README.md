Description: Our project revolves around self-directed learning and teaching. From the instructor's perspective, our program offers a platform for creating problem sets and specifying grading criteria. On the student side, learners can articulate their approaches and responses through either text input or file uploads. Our software will assess student responses, providing constructive feedback when inaccuracies are detected, pinpointing the specific areas of their approach that require correction. Students can subsequently refine their approaches in response to this feedback. Another notable feature of our program is its automated grading capabilities, which can assess answers ranging from simple numerical responses to lengthy essays with precision.
